An application to gather support for multiple brands of home automation under a single app.

The application is far from done or ready to use. I am starting to have most of the back-end in order. I have also added support for white LEDs by LimitlessLED.
I am still missing the web-interface to control the devices, as well as web services.

Here are some of the planned features:

 * Fully responsive HTML 5 web-interface to control all devices easily.
 * Automation such as auto turn off lights on specific triggers etc.
 * Apps for mobile devices. Including features like turn off all lights when none of the mobile devices are connected to wifi anymore.

Some of the devices I plan on supporting initially (since I use a mix of these devices at home):

 * LimitlessLED (White and maybe RBG later)
 * Belkin Wemo (both white LED bulbs, power switches and motion sensors).
 * Philips Hue
 * Yamaha AV Receiver
 * Chromecast (possibly, depends how easy it is. But I'm thinking stuff like pause video when phone rings)
 * Nuimo (for control of light etc. Read more about it on [Kickstarter here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/802159142/nuimo-seamless-smart-home-interface/description))
